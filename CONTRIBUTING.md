# Contributing to Space Engineers Mods 🚀

Thanks for showing interest in contributing! Whether you’re here to squash bugs, add cool features, or just make the mods even more awesome, we’re excited to have you on board! Let’s make these mods better together. Here’s how you can jump in and start contributing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs 🐛
- Found a bug? No worries! Use the [Bug Report Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to let us know.
- Make sure to include:
  - Steps to reproduce the bug (so we can break it too).
  - The mod version and Space Engineers version you’re running.
  - Any screenshots, log files, or errors you’ve found.
- Before you submit, take a peek at the issue tracker to see if someone else beat you to it.

### Requesting Features 🌟
- Got an epic idea to level up a mod? Use the [Feature Request Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and let’s make it happen.
- Help us understand:
  - The problem it solves or how it’ll improve gameplay.
  - What your ideal solution looks like.
  - Any alternative ideas you’ve thought about.
- Try to keep your request in line with the mod’s theme so it stays on brand!

### Submitting Pull Requests 🔧
- **Fork** the repo, create a **new branch**, and let’s get cracking! Name your branch like `feature/add-awesome-feature` or `bugfix/fix-annoying-bug`.
- When you’re ready to submit your work, follow the [Pull Request Template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md):
  - Tell us what your change does and why it’s important.
  - Make sure your changes fit the mod’s structure and purpose.
- Test your changes before submitting! Play around in both **singleplayer** and **multiplayer** (if relevant) to make sure everything works smoothly.
- If you’re adding something complex, don’t forget to comment your code so the rest of us can follow along. 📝

### Code Style Guidelines 💻
- **C# Coding Style**:
  - Use `PascalCase` for classes and methods, `camelCase` for variables.
  - Document public methods and classes with XML comments (`/// <summary>`), so everything stays clear and neat.
  - Keep it clean! Avoid bloated or redundant code.
- **Keep It Efficient**: Space Engineers can be a beast on performance, so make sure your changes run smoothly and don’t cause lag spikes!
- **No Unit Tests**: Don’t worry about unit testing—just make sure you’ve tested your code in-game thoroughly.
